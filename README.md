# 🐍 Python Starter Algorithms and CLI Applications  

## 📘 Overview  

A collection of **Command Line Interface (CLI)** applications developed to strengthen my **Python fundamentals** and **algorithmic problem-solving** skills as a **1st-year Computer Engineering student**.  

This repository reflects my journey of building algorithmic thinking through small yet practical CLI-based programs that focus on **data structures**, **loops**, **conditionals**, and **functional programming**.
