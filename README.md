# 🐍 Python Starter Algorithms and CLI Applications

## ✨ Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Command Line Interface (CLI)** applications developed to strengthen my **Python fundamentals** and **algorithmic thinking** as a **1st-year Computer Engineering student**.

**🎯 Main Goal:** Demonstrate proficiency in Python data structures (Lists, Dictionaries), loops, conditionals, and functional programming.
